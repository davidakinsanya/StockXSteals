# StockXSteals

L8test. (formerly known as StockXSteals) is a trainers centred data analytics android application tasked with sourcing up-to-date pricing information on the trainers of a userâ€™s choosing or one of the very latest trending trainers. This project was a big step forward in the right direction to launching my android developer career.
